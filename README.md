# Algorithmic-Trading
This coding project consists of 9 different coding files:
1.StrategyLearner.py
2.indicators.py
3. BagLearner.py
4. marketsimcode.py 
5.ManualStrategy.py
6. experiment1.py
7. experiment2.py
8. RTLearner.py
9. testproject.py 

All the outputs from each individual coding file 
can be generated by running testproject.py. 
*Everything is ran from testproject.py

Running:

RUn the tesproject.py script. It calls the other scripts and outputs everything as needed.  

File description:

1.StrategyLearner.py
Classification-based regression learner 

2.indicators.py
Indicators used for both strategy and manual learners - sma, BBV, MACD  

3. BagLearner.py
Learner that takes the RTlearner to compute the random forest 

4. marketsimcode.py 
Code used to generate trades dataframe using results from strategy/manula learner

5.ManualStrategy.py
Intuition based strategy using the three indicators 

6. experiment1.py
Experiment to compare performance of strategy, benchmark and manual learners

7. experiment2.py
Experiment to compare change in impact on strategy learner trading results

8. RTLearner.py
Code used to implement random tree

9. testproject.py 
calls the other scripts and outputs every plot as needed.
